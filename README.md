## Description
This is a basic HTML project designed to practice and reinforce core skills from The Odin Project’s Foundation curriculum. The project features a collection of recipes, each organized with a title, image, brief description, ingredient list, and step-by-step preparation instructions.

## Features
Semantic HTML: Focused on proper document structure.

Image Integration: Displays recipe visuals with appropriate alt text.

Organized Content: Uses ordered and unordered lists for clarity.

## What I Learnt
Building this project helped solidify several foundational development habits:


- **Architecture First**: I realized the importance of thinking through the project layout and structure before jumping into the code.


- **Git Workflow**: I practiced frequent use of git status to track my progress and ensure a clean version control history through consistent `git add` and `git commit` snapshots.
