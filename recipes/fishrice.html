    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Fish Rice is a versatile, nutrient-dense, and quick-cooking comfort meal consisting of fried or baked fish tossed with rice and crunchy vegetables.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Rice: Use any kind of non-starchy rice because it is less sticky, like basmati or jasmine, but any type of long-grain rice will work.</li>
        <li>Fish: Use 2 to 3 fillets or steaks of any firm fish you like, such as salmon, snapper, Spanish mackerel (kingfish), cod, bass, haddock, or catfish.</li>
        <li>Ghee/butter/oil: Use ghee for flavor, or a mix of ghee and oil.</li>
        <li>Alternatively, use unsalted high-quality butter or your preferred cooking oil.</li>
        <li>Aromatics: 1 small onion (thinly sliced), 1 teaspoon chopped garlic, 3/4 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste (or 1/2 tsp each grated), and 2 sprigs of curry leaves (divided).</li>
        <li>Spices: 1/2 to 1 teaspoon red chili powder, 1 teaspoon garam masala, 1/8 teaspoon turmeric powder (optional), 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, and salt.</li>
        <li>Vegetables: 1 1/2 cups chopped carrots, 1 cup frozen peas (thawed), and 2 to 3 green chilies (slit).</li>
        <li>Extras: 10 whole cashews (split), 10 raisins (optional), and 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook Rice: Add 1 cup of uncooked rice to a bowl and rinse well.</li>
        <li>Drain completely, pour in fresh water, and bring to a rolling boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook until the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked through.</li>
        <li>Prep the Fish: Coat the fish with lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, and salt.</li>
        <li>Leave aside for 10 minutes while you prep the onions and other ingredients.</li>
        <li>Fry the Fish: Heat oil or ghee and add half of the curry leaves.</li>
        <li>Place the fish in the pan and fry for 3 minutes, then flip.</li>
        <li>Add 1/3 of the red chili powder and fry on both sides until cooked through. Transfer to a plate.</li>
        <li>Make Fish Rice: Heat ghee or oil in the same pan.</li>
        <li>Add garlic, onions, carrots, green chilies, cashews, raisins, and the remaining curry leaves.</li>
        <li>Saute until the nuts turn lightly golden and the onions begin to caramelize, taking care not to burn them.</li>
        <li>Add the cooled rice, salt, peas, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Mix well and heat through; taste and adjust salt or pepper as needed.</li>
        <li>Serve the rice and fish together.</li>
    </ol>
