    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Nigerian egusi soup, also known as efo elegusi, is a delicious and versatile soup served with pounded yam, which is a staple dish.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pounded Yam: 1 medium yam, water, and salt.</li>
        <li>Egusi Soup Base: 1 1/2 cups egusi, 1/4 cup palm oil, and 1 tablespoon fermented locust beans.</li>
        <li>Proteins: 3 tablespoons ground crayfish, 1 cup dried fish, 3 smoked mackerel fillets, and 1 cup mixed seafood.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Pounded Yam</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the yam, slice, and wash it.</li>
            <li>Cook with water and salt until completely soft.</li>
            <li>Using a mortar and pestle, pound the yam until soft and sticky, sprinkling with yam water at intervals.</li>
            <li>Mold into desired shapes and set aside.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Egusi Soup</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Blend the red bell pepper, Scotch bonnet peppers, tomatoes, and one onion in a food processor with a cup of water.</li>
            <li>Defrost the frozen seafood, then wash and slice the kale.</li>
            <li>Chop the remaining onion and cut the smoked mackerel fillets into smaller pieces.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a saucepan for 30 seconds, then add the chopped onions.</li>
            <li>Fry until the onions appear translucent, then add the locust beans and stir for one minute.</li>
            <li>Add the blended pepper mix and cook for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Add 3 to 4 cups of water, the dried fish, ground crayfish, and a little salt to taste.</li>
            <li>Note: Smoked mackerel is salty and will increase the soup's saltiness, so adjust seasoning accordingly.</li>
            <li>Simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix 2 tablespoons of the cooking sauce into the egusi to make a thick paste.</li>
            <li>Form small egusi balls by hand and drop them into the pan.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat and cook for at least 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix in the kale and smoked mackerel.</li>
            <li>If the soup is too thick, add more water and simmer for 10 minutes on low heat.</li>
            <li>Add the seafood and cook for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and serve.</li>
        </ol>
