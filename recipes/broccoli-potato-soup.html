    <h2>Description</h2>

    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large yellow onion and 1 large carrot.</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves and 2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes (about 6 medium).</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil and 1 quart vegetable broth.</li>
        <li>1/2 cup raw unsalted cashews and 1 teaspoon kosher salt (divided).</li>
        <li>1 pound frozen broccoli florets (or 4 cups small steamed broccoli florets).</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme and 3/4 teaspoon dried dill.</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons white wine vinegar and 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Dice the onion and mince the garlic.</li>
        <li>Peel the potatoes and cut them into bite-sized chunks.</li>
        <li>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add the onion and saute for 5 minutes, then add the garlic and saute for an additional minute.</li>
        <li>Add the vegetable broth, cashews, potatoes, and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt; bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce to a rapid simmer and cook for about 15 minutes until the potatoes are tender and falling apart.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, thaw frozen broccoli under hot water and chop into smaller florets as necessary.</li>
        <li>Place the broccoli in a bowl and mix it with 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Peel and grate the carrot into long strips.</li>
        <li>When the potatoes are tender, transfer the mixture to a blender using a ladle.</li>
        <li>Add the thyme, dill, white wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, and another 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt.</li>
        <li>Hold the lid tight and blend for a minute or two until fully creamy.</li>
        <li>Pour the creamy soup back into the pot, add the broccoli and carrot, and simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Taste and add additional salt if necessary.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If you’re cooking fresh broccoli, here’s how to simulate frozen: Cut it into very small florets.</li>
        <li>Then steam it but cook it a few minutes longer so that it’s very tender (not crisp tender as indicated in the recipe).</li>
        <li>Leave out any seasoning, since you’ll add salt as part of the soup recipe.</li>
    </ul>
